# NLP Models and Tasks

Welcome to the NLP Models and Tasks repository! This repository aims to provide a practical and accessible way for beginners to learn about natural language processing (NLP) using PyTorch. 
To run a specific file inside a module do as follows: `python -m path.to.file` (without .py extension).

The repository includes implementations of various NLP models and tasks such as:
* Transformer model for machine translation and classification (TODO)
* BERT model for text classification (TODO)
* GPT model for text generation (TODO
* Question-Answering model for comprehension tasks (TODO)

Please note that these implementations are intended for learning purposes and may not be the most optimized versions of the models. Each class, function, method has an informative docstring, specifying even the input and output shapes. 

## Models and Tasks

### Transformer Model for Machine Translation
The transformer model is implemented for German-to-English translation using the multi30k dataset. The training implementation is temporary based on the official PyTorch tutorial on language translation. See the main.py file, in the future I will develop different trainers for different task with classes.

### BERT Model for Text Classification

### GPT Model for Text Generation

### Question-Answering Model for Comprehension Tasks
